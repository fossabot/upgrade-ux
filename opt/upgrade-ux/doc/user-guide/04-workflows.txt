= Workflows
The workflows (or commands) available can be listed with the +-h+ option:

    upgrade-ux -h
    ....
    List of commands:
     dump            dump configuration and system information
     mkdist          create a compressed tar archive distribution
     purgelogs       purge the LOG [/home/gdhaese1/projects/upgrade-ux/var/opt/upgrade-ux/log] directory
     test            a simple test workflow
     upgrade         upgrade the operating system
    
== Dump workflow
The dump workflow was already discussed during the configuration chapter:

The first part displays the system definitions, such as OS, hardware type and OS version.
The second part shows the configuration part and which files it could find (or you may define, create and/or use). They do not need to exist.

The following example shows the dump on a RHEl 7 system:

These configuration files live under the +/etc/opt/upgrade-ux+ or +./upgrade-ux/etc/opt/upgrade-ux+ (relative path) directory.
At this moment we have the following configuration files present (however, it will grow over time):

    #-> ls -lR

== Mkdist workflow
The mkdist workflow creates a compressed tar file of the current development tree, which only makes sense when you are using the +git clone+ version of upgrade-ux. The compressed tar file is stored under +/tmp+ file system and is called +/tmp/upgrade-ux-0.9.tar.gz+ (the version can be different of course).

== Purgelogs workflow
The purgelogs workflow just has a simple function and that is to purge log files which are older than 30 days. It will display the logs it has purged (only when you are using the option +-v+):

    #-> opt/upgrade-ux/bin/upgrade-uxi -v purgelogs
    

== Test workflow
The test workflow is a very simplistic test (use option +-v+ to see something):

    #-> opt/upgrade-ux/bin/upgrade-ux -v test
    upgrade-ux 0.9 / Git
    Using log file: /home/gdhaese1/projects/upgrade-ux/var/opt/upgrade-ux/log/upgrade-ux-20140625-1354-LOGFILE.log
    no stale NFS mount points found
    
== Upgrade workflow
The upgrade workflow is the real work horse here and in fact is the default workflow (meaning if no workflow is mentioned we will assume you mean +upgrade+).

The upgrade workflow has two modes:

 - _preview mode_: is going through the complete flow checking all software and simulating an update of the system. Is a perfect way to examine your system to see whether any underlying issues could prevent a successful upgrade. You can do the preview (option +-p+) any time and as much as you like. However, before doing the _upgrade mode_ you are forced to go through a successful _preview mode_ as well.
 - _upgrade mode_: is doing again all the checks, writing evidence and applying all the patch bundles or doing the upgrade. The system might reboot. After the reboot you can continue with retyping +/opt/upgrade-ux/bin/upgrade-ux -v+ and it will continue from the point it was interrupted by the reboot as upgrade-ux keeps track of it stages.
