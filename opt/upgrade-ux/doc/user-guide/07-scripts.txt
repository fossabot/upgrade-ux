= The upgrade-ux scripts

The scripts that are sourced by the main script `upgrade-ux` reside under `/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/` directory and the easiest way to know what will be sourced is by running `/opt/upgrade-ux/bin/upgrade-ux -s`:

NOTE: It depends on the OS architecture (see `dump` workflow) which scripts will be sources. In above example it was on HP hardware.

In every _stage_ directory you will find minumum a `default` directory which is sourced by every OS and a hardware specific directory, such as:

 - hp
 - GNU/Linux
 - sunos
 - aix

The scripts found under these directories are only sourced when you run `upgrade-ux` on those HW architectures (make sense, no?).
If you need new scripts just write a small script called `my_script.sh` (the `.sh` is important!) and it will be picked up the next time automatically.

NOTE: there is no need to make these small scripts executable (nor is it required to start with `#!/bin/sh` or whatever).

An example of such a script is `/opt/upgrade-ux/scripts/preinstall/default/05_reboot_required.sh`
[source,bash]
----
# cat preinstall/default/05_reboot_required.sh
# 05_reboot_required.sh
# if the uptime of the system is higher then 30 days then we propose to reboot first

# pre-define daysup as 0 (we can check this variable later [after a reboot])
daysup=0

# when uptime is not expressed in days then we probably just rebooted our system
uptime | grep -q days || return

daysup=$( uptime | awk '{print $3}' )
IsDigit $daysup || daysup=$( w | head -1 | awk '{print $3}' )  # alternative method
IsDigit $daysup || daysup=0

if [[ $daysup -gt $DAYSUPTIME ]]; then
    if (( PREVIEW )) ; then
        LogPrint "Uptime of system is $daysup (>$DAYSUPTIME days) - recommend to reboot before patching"
    else
        Error "Uptime of system is $daysup (>$DAYSUPTIME days) - reboot is required before patching with $PRODUCT"
    fi

Now it is up to you! If you wish to add new scripts it is always usefull to first make a new issue at GitHub: https://github.com/gdha/upgrade-ux/issues
