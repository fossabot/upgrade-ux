= Configuration

== Upgrade-ux related configuration files

The configuration files that +upgrade-ux+ uses are basically just shell scripts and should be treated as such.

The default location of the configuration files is +/etc/opt/upgrade-ux/+. However, if you are working with the sources (e.g. via git clone) then it is perfectly possible to use the relative paths, e.g.

    ls $HOME/project/upgrade-ux/etc/opt/upgrade-ux/

The easiest way to explain which configuration files are possible is by showing the output of the +upgrade-ux dump+ command:

=== Default configuration file default.conf
The +default.conf+ contains lots of variables which should not be changed by the end-user. If you wish to modify one just redefine it in the +local.conf+ file. 

A good example of such variable is the +YEAR+. In the +default.conf+ it is defined as:

    # The default year to use with our patch bundle is *current year* [ $(date '+%Y') ] - to overrule define it manually
    # in the local.conf file. E.g. when running upgrade-ux in 2015 but still installing patches from 2014 then define: YEAR=2014
    YEAR=$(date '+%Y')
    

However, in some case as mentioned above, if in the year 2015 you still want to install patch bundles of 2014 then it is necessary to define the +YEAR+ variable in the +local.conf+ file, as +YEAR=2014+ (or whatever, the year might be).

=== Local configuration file local.conf
The +local.conf+ should only contain variables which you want to overrule, as desctibed in previous section (of the +default.conf+ file). It is important to know that the +local.conf+ file is the last configuration file which is read by +upgrade-ux+ and therefore, the variables defined are the ones that will be used.

=== Operating Specific configuration files

On each OS you have specific OS related configuration files, e.g.

    HP-UX.conf 
    GNU/Linux.conf
    SunOS.conf

These configuration files typically contain variables which has only a meaning that specific OS, e.g. on HP-UX

    SWINSTALL=/usr/sbin/swinstall


== The INI files

The INI files are OS specific (always) and contain the definitions of which patch bundles should be installed or removed, and so on.
It follows also the different stages
